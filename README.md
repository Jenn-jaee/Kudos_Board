    - [x] Text and icons use a dark color
    - [x] The background uses a light color
    - [x] Color contrast has at least a 4.5:1 ratio using this [color contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
  - [x] The chosen mode (light or dark) persists when navigating from home page to board pages and vice versa.
  - [x] When the user first visits the site the theme defaults to light mode.
  - [] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: To ease the grading process, please use the [color contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to demonstrate to the grading team that text and background colors on your website have appropriate contrast in both light and dark mode. The Contrast Ratio should be above 4.5:1 and should have a green box surrounding it.
- [ ] **Pinned Cards**
  - [ ] Users can pin a card to the top of the board.
  - [ ] A Pin button is displayed on each card.
  - [ ] When the user clicks the Pin button of an unpinned card:
    - [ ] The card moves to the top of the grid view for that board.
    - [ ] There is some visual feedback to indicate a card's pin status (e.g., a pin icon, a border highlight).
    - [ ] The pin action is saved so that the card remains pinned after page refreshes.
  - [ ] When the user clicks the Pin button of a pinned card:
    - [ ] The card returns to its original position in the grid based on its creation time or to the end of the grid.
    - [ ] The card's pin status (e.g., a pin icon or highlight) is removed.
    - [ ] The unpin action is saved so that the card remains unpinned after page refresh.
  - [ ] Pinned cards always appear at the top of the board, above unpinned cards.
  - [ ] If multiple cards are pinned, they maintain their pinned order based on the time they were pinned.
    - [ ] More recent pins should appear first.
- [ ] The pinned state of a card persists when:

### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

- Yes, the topics from the labs were crucial in helping me navigate through this project. They introduced foundational skills like working with routes, CRUD operations, form handling, and styling with React. However, I found myself somewhat unprepared when it came to connecting everything across multiple routing files in my backend. I initially attempted a more modular setup by splitting routes into separate files for cleanliness and scalability, but it proved challenging to connect everything seamlessly. After several failed attempts, I decided to consolidate everything into a single index.js file, which finally allowed my backend to communicate properly with the frontend. This experience taught me not just about backend logic, but also about the importance of adaptability when troubleshooting.



- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

With more time, I would have liked to implement the final stretch feature pinning cards to the top of a board. It was a feature I explored, but due to the complexity of the logic and the time constraints, I felt it was risky to attempt on the last day, especially with the risk of breaking my working code. I also would have spent more time refactoring my backend to be better organized and more scalable perhaps retrying the modular routing strategy with a clearer understanding of how to manage dependencies and middleware across multiple files.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During the demo, I was proud of how smoothly my dark mode toggle, comment functionality, and real-time delete action worked. These were some of the more interactive stretch features that made my app feel polished and complete. One thing that didn’t go quite as planned was my earlier delete functionality for boards—it required users to refresh the page manually to reflect changes, which I later fixed by updating the frontend state without relying on a reload. Watching my peers’ demos also inspired me, especially seeing different approaches to user feedback and UI organization. It gave me ideas for future enhancements.

### Shout out

Big shout out to the entire support system—my TA, my instructors. A special thanks to Erika, Ebony and Virsaviya, who helped me debug a tricky backend routing issue and encouraged me not to give up when things felt overwhelming.
